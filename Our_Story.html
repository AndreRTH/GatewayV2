  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <img src="Images/ReFounder.jpg" alt="The founder of Kyoshi Sushi" class="the-founder">
  <p class="our-story-info"><strong>The Beginning</strong><i>Our story begins with Tomaka Kyoshi towards the end of the Edo period in Japan. He began life as a humble farmer and fisherman, providing for his family. He became well-known in his village for his superb cooking skills, and soon many would come from the surrounding areas to try his food. His most well-known dish was his sushi, of course. He soon gave up farming and started his own restaurant. Over time he passed down his recipes to his sons and the Kyoshi legacy carried on over two centuries later. Today his descendants continue in his footsteps.</i></p>

  <p class="kyoshi-today"><strong>Kyoshi Today</strong><i>The current head chef Hideo has passed on his knowledge to his son Hirokodaki, who will succeed him as head chef upon his passing. He will be the sixth generation Kyoshi to continue the family legacy, and eventually, one day pass the business down to his son Tanjiro.</i></p>
